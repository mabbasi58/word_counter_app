# word_counter_app

The task involves creating a React-based "Word Counter App" with the following steps and requirements:

1. **Set Up a React Project:**
   - Begin by setting up a new React project using a tool like Create React App (CRA) or your preferred React development environment.

2. **Create Components:**
   - Create React components for the Word Counter App. You will need at least two components:
     - InputArea: This component will contain an input field where users can enter or paste text.
     - ResultDisplay: This component will display the word count and potentially other statistics.

3. **Implement Word Count Functionality:**
   - Implement a JavaScript function or use a library to count words in the provided text. You can use simple string manipulation techniques to split the text into words and count them.

4. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - Optionally, you can handle edge cases like counting characters, sentences, or paragraphs, depending on the complexity of your app and requirements.

5. **Real-Time Word Count Updates:**
   - Utilize React state and event handlers to update the word count in real-time as the user types or pastes text into the input area. This involves using React's `useState` hook or class component state management to keep track of the word count as it changes.

6. **Styling the App:**
   - Style the Word Counter App using CSS or styling libraries like styled-components, Material-UI, or Bootstrap. Ensure that the app is visually appealing and user-friendly.

7. **Testing:**
   - Test the app to ensure that it accurately counts words and updates the word count in real-time as expected. Pay attention to edge cases and handle them appropriately.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Include clear and concise documentation that describes how to use the Word Counter App, including any special features or edge cases you've implemented.
